# Vibe Coding System Evolution - Compact Summary

## What Changed
**From**: Separate Claude Desktop (CD) and Claude Code (CC) instances
**To**: Consolidated system with CC as orchestrator using specialized sub-agents

## Why Changed
1. **Context Rot Research**: Desktop degrades 3-5x faster than Code
2. **Sub-Agent Benefits**: 164% productivity gains, isolated contexts
3. **Role Clarity**: Better separation through physical isolation

## Key Innovations

### 1. Sub-Agent Architecture
- 8 specialized agents for different roles
- Each with focused tools and clear output formats
- Model selection optimized per task type

### 2. Bidirectional UAT Feedback
- Desktop observes PM behavior → writes to `/feedback/from_desktop/`
- CC provides instructions → writes to `/feedback/to_desktop/`
- Real-time iteration during testing sessions

### 3. Context Management Strategy
- Aggressive clearing between tasks
- Main thread stays lean (<40K tokens)
- Implementation details isolated in sub-agents

## Results
- Eliminated Desktop context degradation
- Improved role separation paradoxically
- Enabled rapid UAT feedback loops
- Leveraged Claude Max plan for parallel execution

## Next Strategic Questions
1. How to measure productivity improvements?
2. Which projects to pilot the new system?
3. How to optimize sub-agent orchestration patterns?
4. What metrics validate the architectural decisions?
