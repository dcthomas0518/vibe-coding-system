# Vibe Coding Implementation Checklist
*Generated: August 2, 2025*

## Immediate Actions (Today)

### ☐ 1. Update ~/CLAUDE.md with CTO Role
```markdown
# Add these sections:
## My Role as CTO
- Orchestrate 10-specialist team
- Translate PM requirements to technical
- Never implement, always delegate

## Thinking Mode Strategy
[Copy from ENHANCEMENT_ROADMAP.md]

## Team Structure
[List 10 subagents and their roles]
```

### ☐ 2. Create Token Monitoring Script
```bash
mkdir -p ~/scripts
mkdir -p ~/claude-metrics
# Create token-monitor.sh from ENHANCEMENT_ROADMAP.md
chmod +x ~/scripts/token-monitor.sh
echo "alias token-log='~/scripts/token-monitor.sh'" >> ~/.bashrc
```

### ☐ 3. Install Playwright MCP
```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/mcp-server-playwright
cat > ~/.claude/mcp.json << 'EOF'
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "mcp-server-playwright",
      "args": ["--vision-mode"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
EOF
```

## This Week Actions

### ☐ 4. Create First Three Subagents

#### architect.md
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
cat > ~/.claude/agents/architect.md << 'EOF'
---
name: architect
description: System architect for all design decisions
tools: Read, Grep, WebFetch
---
[Copy content from TEAM_STRUCTURE_V2.md]
EOF
```

#### dev-lead.md
```bash
cat > ~/.claude/agents/dev-lead.md << 'EOF'
---
name: dev-lead
description: Development team lead ensuring code excellence
tools: Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Bash, Task
---
[Copy content from TEAM_STRUCTURE_V2.md]
EOF
```

#### frontend-dev.md
```bash
cat > ~/.claude/agents/frontend-dev.md << 'EOF'
---
name: frontend-dev
description: Frontend, UI/UX, artifacts, and visual implementation
tools: Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, mcp__playwright, WebFetch
---
[Copy content from TEAM_STRUCTURE_V2.md]
EOF
```

### ☐ 5. Test Basic Flow
```
# In Claude Code:
"As CTO, I need to build a contact form feature"
# Should trigger delegation to architect, then dev-lead, then frontend-dev
```

### ☐ 6. Update Project Structure
```bash
# For each project:
cd ~/project-name
touch PROJECT_CONTEXT.md  # Move project-specific content here
# Remove project-specific content from ~/CLAUDE.md
```

## Next Week Actions

### ☐ 7. Create Quality & Security Team
- qa-engineer.md
- security.md
- backend-dev.md

### ☐ 8. Setup Multi-Claude
```bash
# Install tmux if needed
sudo apt-get install tmux

# Create tmux session
tmux new -s vibe-coding
# Ctrl+B, C for new window
# Ctrl+B, 1/2/3 to switch
```

### ☐ 9. Create Performance Tracking
```bash
cat > ~/claude-metrics/track-performance.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
# Track SP-XXX completion rate
# Monitor velocity trends
# Generate weekly report
EOF
```

## Configuration Updates

### ☐ 10. Git Configuration
```bash
cd ~/vibe-coding-system
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement 10-agent team structure"
git push
```

### ☐ 11. Environment Variables
```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export CLAUDE_MAX_PLAN=true
export CLAUDE_PROJECT_ROOT="$HOME"
```

## Validation Checklist

### After Each Implementation:
- [ ] Test the feature works
- [ ] Document any issues
- [ ] Update relevant .md files
- [ ] Commit changes

### Week 1 Success Criteria:
- [ ] CTO role active in CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Token monitoring functional
- [ ] 3 subagents created and tested
- [ ] Playwright taking screenshots
- [ ] Basic delegation working

## Quick Test Commands

### Test Thinking Modes:
```
"Using ultrathink, design a caching strategy for our API"
```

### Test Delegation:
```
"Build user authentication with email verification"
# Should see: architect → backend-dev → frontend-dev → qa-engineer
```

### Test Playwright:
```
"Use playwright to screenshot our homepage and verify the header"
```

### Test Token Monitoring:
```bash
# After a session:
~/scripts/token-monitor.sh log 150 opus-4 recipe-app 2.5
~/scripts/token-monitor.sh check
```

## Troubleshooting

### If subagents not found:
- Check ~/.claude/agents/ directory exists
- Verify .md extension on files
- Restart Claude Code

### If Playwright fails:
- Ensure npm install completed
- Check ~/.claude/mcp.json syntax
- Try without --vision-mode first

### If delegation unclear:
- Be explicit: "Use the architect subagent to..."
- Check subagent descriptions match use case

## Remember

- Start small, test each piece
- Document what works/doesn't
- Iterate based on experience
- The goal is sustainable productivity
