# Sessions Log

## Session: August 2, 2025 - Vibe Coding System Consolidation

### Major Architectural Evolution
**Decision**: Consolidated CD and CC roles within Claude Code using sub-agents
**Rationale**: 
- Context degradation research shows 3-5x better performance in Code vs Desktop
- Sub-agents provide 164% productivity gains with isolated contexts
- Eliminates "lost in the middle" phenomenon through aggressive context management

### Key Implementations
1. **Created 8 Specialized Sub-Agents**:
   - system-architect: Architecture design
   - scrum-master: Sprint management
   - cc-developer: Implementation
   - qa-reviewer: Quality assurance
   - security-auditor: Vulnerability scanning
   - test-automator: Test creation
   - performance-engineer: Optimization
   - ux-analyst: User behavior analysis

2. **Bidirectional Feedback System**:
   - `/feedback/from_desktop/`: Desktop writes UX observations
   - `/feedback/to_desktop/`: CC provides artifact instructions
   - Enables real-time UAT iteration loops

3. **Model Selection Strategy**:
   - Opus-4 for architecture, security, UX analysis
   - Sonnet-4 for implementation, testing
   - Dynamic escalation based on complexity
   - PM override commands supported

### Technical Decisions
- Claude Max plan ($200/mo) enables aggressive parallel sub-agent usage
- Desktop limited to /feedback/ directory access only
- UAT protocol with copy-paste instructions for PM
- Git checkpoint after every SP-XXX completion

### Next Steps
- Test sub-agent workflow on real project
- Validate UAT feedback loop effectiveness
- Monitor context management improvements
- Measure productivity gains vs previous system

## Session: August 3, 2025 - V2 Implementation Phase 1

### Completed V2 System Upgrade - Phase 1
**Achievement**: Transformed from triumvirate to 10-agent specialist team (partial)

### Key Implementations
1. **Updated ~/CLAUDE.md**:
   - Added full CTO role definition
   - Changed all PM references to Founder/Dale
   - Added 10-specialist team structure
   - Fixed memory hierarchy and session protocols
   - Added self-learning protocol
   - Added SPEC and sign-off column to decision authority

2. **Token Monitoring System**:
   - Created ~/scripts/token-monitor.sh
   - Tracks usage against 5-hour windows (800 prompts max)
   - Color-coded warnings at 80% and 90% thresholds
   - Added 'token-log' alias to .bashrc
   - Tested successfully - currently at 18% usage

3. **Playwright MCP Configuration**:
   - Installed at ~/.claude/mcp.json
   - Uses npx @playwright/mcp@latest
   - Ready for screenshot and visual testing

4. **First 3 Subagents Created**:
   - **architect.md**: System design specialist (tools: Read, Grep, WebFetch)
   - **dev-lead.md**: Implementation lead with >90% test coverage mandate
   - **frontend-dev.md**: UI/UX specialist, artifact creator, Playwright user
   - All stored in ~/.claude/agents/

### Validation
- Successfully tested architect subagent with contact form design
- Produced comprehensive architecture with security, performance, and monitoring considerations
- Delegation flow working as expected

### Technical Decisions
- Claude Code main thread = CTO (not separate subagent)
- Subagents start fresh with no memory between calls
- Frontend-dev owns all artifact creation
- Each specialist has specific tool access

### Metrics
- Time to complete Phase 1: ~2 hours
- Subagents created: 3/10 (30%)
- System grade progress: A- â†’ A+ (estimated)

### Next Sprint (Week 2)
- Create remaining 7 subagents
- Set up multi-Claude with tmux
- Create performance tracking scripts
- Test parallel subagent execution
- Implement weekly self-improvement protocol
