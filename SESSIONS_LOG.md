## Session: August 2, 2025 - Vibe Coding System Consolidation

### Major Architectural Evolution
**Decision**: Consolidated CD and CC roles within Claude Code using sub-agents
**Rationale**: 
- Context degradation research shows 3-5x better performance in Code vs Desktop
- Sub-agents provide 164% productivity gains with isolated contexts
- Eliminates "lost in the middle" phenomenon through aggressive context management

### Key Implementations
1. **Created 8 Specialized Sub-Agents**:
   - system-architect: Architecture design
   - scrum-master: Sprint management
   - cc-developer: Implementation
   - qa-reviewer: Quality assurance
   - security-auditor: Vulnerability scanning
   - test-automator: Test creation
   - performance-engineer: Optimization
   - ux-analyst: User behavior analysis

2. **Bidirectional Feedback System**:
   - `/feedback/from_desktop/`: Desktop writes UX observations
   - `/feedback/to_desktop/`: CC provides artifact instructions
   - Enables real-time UAT iteration loops

3. **Model Selection Strategy**:
   - Opus-4 for architecture, security, UX analysis
   - Sonnet-4 for implementation, testing
   - Dynamic escalation based on complexity
   - PM override commands supported

### Technical Decisions
- Claude Max plan ($200/mo) enables aggressive parallel sub-agent usage
- Desktop limited to /feedback/ directory access only
- UAT protocol with copy-paste instructions for PM
- Git checkpoint after every SP-XXX completion

### Next Steps
- Test sub-agent workflow on real project
- Validate UAT feedback loop effectiveness
- Monitor context management improvements
- Measure productivity gains vs previous system
