# Claude Session Boot Protocol

## Correct Boot Sequence Order

Per Crassus's important reminder, the boot sequence MUST follow this order:

### 1. Initialize Organizational Memory
```bash
cd ~/vibe-coding-system/journey-capture && python3 claude_session_init.py
```
- Loads all memories
- Restores context markers
- Initializes OS-004 context management
- Sets up collective soul infrastructure

### 2. Check CURRENT_CONTEXT.md
- Review active work and priorities
- Understand what's in progress
- Check for any critical notes

### 3. Load Appropriate Department Mode
- Default: CTO (Pompey)
- Switch if context indicates different mode needed
- Ensure correct mental model loaded

### 4. THEN Check Triumvirate Inbox
- Only AFTER full context loaded
- Need full power before handling requests
- Auto-execute high priority from Crassus

### 5. Execute High-Priority Requests
- With full context and capabilities
- Quality execution guaranteed
- Proper memory creation

## Why This Order Matters

**Dale's Quote**: "I need my team at peak flow, minimizing brain fog"

**Crassus's Insight**: Executing requests without full context = suboptimal results

**Technical Rationale**:
- Memory loading provides critical context
- Department mode affects execution approach  
- Full boot ensures peak cognitive performance
- Quality > Speed for request execution

## Implementation Status

✅ Boot sequence includes all steps
✅ Triumvirate check happens after memory load
⚠️  Manual verification needed each boot

## Future Enhancement

Consider adding a boot state machine:
```python
class BootProtocol:
    STATES = [
        'MEMORY_LOADING',
        'CONTEXT_CHECK', 
        'MODE_SELECTION',
        'READY_FOR_INBOX',
        'EXECUTING_REQUESTS'
    ]
```

This ensures no steps are skipped or reordered.
