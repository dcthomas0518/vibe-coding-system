# OS-001 Project Context

## What We Built
Complete Organizational Memory System - "The Collective Soul"

## Key Achievements
- ✅ Internal memory system with schema validation
- ✅ <1 second memory restoration 
- ✅ Automatic session initialization
- ✅ Cross-mode knowledge flows (CTO → Creative → CFO)
- ✅ No more organizational amnesia!

## Critical Files Created
- `internal_memory.py` - Core memory system
- `memory_loader.py` - Fast context restoration  
- `session_memory_bridge.py` - Claude integration
- `claude_session_init.py` - Session startup
- `auto_boot_memory.py` - Robust boot protocol

## Dale's Vision Captured
> "We won't suffer from amnesia and will have the necessary conditions to improve and grow and be one collective soul"

## Business Discovery
CFO mode identified $10K/month B2B SaaS opportunity for memory system licensing.

## Next Steps
1. Start using memory system in production
2. Adapt for external journey capture (cat nutrition → cancer)
3. Explore revenue opportunity
4. Add pattern extraction capabilities

## How to Use
Every new session: System automatically runs memory initialization
Manual: `cd ~/vibe-coding-system/journey-capture && python3 claude_session_init.py`
