## Context Management

### Token Thresholds
- Optimal: <40K tokens
- Warning: 40-80K tokens  
- Critical: >80K tokens
- Emergency: >100K tokens

When tokens exceed 80K, the system should trigger a smart reboot.

## Model Selection Strategy
- Use opus-4.1 for architecture and complex tasks
- Delegate to sonnet-4 for implementation
- Always use ultrathink for critical decisions
