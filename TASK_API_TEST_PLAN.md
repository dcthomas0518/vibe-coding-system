# Task Management API Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive test plan for the Task Management API, covering all endpoints with focus on test scenarios, edge cases, and coverage requirements.

## API Endpoints
1. POST /tasks - Create a new task
2. GET /tasks - List tasks with pagination
3. GET /tasks/{id} - Get a single task
4. PUT /tasks/{id} - Update a task
5. DELETE /tasks/{id} - Delete a task

## Test Environment Requirements
- Test database (isolated from production)
- API test framework (e.g., Jest, Pytest, Postman)
- Mock authentication service (if required)
- Test data generation utilities
- Performance testing tools (e.g., JMeter, K6)

## Test Data Model
Expected Task object structure:
```json
{
  "id": "string (UUID)",
  "title": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "status": "enum (pending, in_progress, completed, cancelled)",
  "priority": "enum (low, medium, high, critical)",
  "due_date": "ISO 8601 datetime",
  "created_at": "ISO 8601 datetime",
  "updated_at": "ISO 8601 datetime",
  "assigned_to": "string (user_id)",
  "tags": ["array of strings"],
  "metadata": {}
}
```

## 1. POST /tasks - Create Task

### Functional Tests

#### Valid Request Scenarios
1. **Create minimal task**
   - Request: `{"title": "New Task"}`
   - Expected: 201 Created, returns task with generated ID and defaults

2. **Create complete task**
   - Request: All fields populated with valid data
   - Expected: 201 Created, all fields correctly saved

3. **Create task with special characters**
   - Request: Title/description with unicode, emojis, special chars
   - Expected: 201 Created, characters preserved

### Validation Tests

1. **Missing required field**
   - Request: `{}` (no title)
   - Expected: 400 Bad Request, error: "title is required"

2. **Invalid field types**
   - Request: `{"title": 123}` (number instead of string)
   - Expected: 400 Bad Request, error: "title must be string"

3. **Invalid enum values**
   - Request: `{"status": "invalid_status"}`
   - Expected: 400 Bad Request, error: "invalid status value"

4. **Invalid date format**
   - Request: `{"due_date": "not-a-date"}`
   - Expected: 400 Bad Request, error: "invalid date format"

5. **Title length validation**
   - Too short: `{"title": ""}`
   - Too long: `{"title": "x".repeat(256)}`
   - Expected: 400 Bad Request with appropriate error

### Edge Cases

1. **Duplicate task creation (if unique constraint)**
   - Create same task twice rapidly
   - Expected: Depends on business logic (allow or reject)

2. **SQL injection attempts**
   - Request: `{"title": "'; DROP TABLE tasks; --"}`
   - Expected: 201 Created with escaped content

3. **XSS attempts**
   - Request: `{"title": "<script>alert('xss')</script>"}`
   - Expected: 201 Created with sanitized content

4. **Large payload**
   - Request: Task with very large description/metadata
   - Expected: 413 Payload Too Large or successful creation with limits

5. **Null vs undefined fields**
   - Test behavior with explicit null values
   - Expected: Consistent handling
