# ADR-001: Event Streaming Platform Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to choose an event streaming platform for our user behavior data pipeline that can handle:
- 50,000+ events per second sustained load
- 200,000+ events per second peak load
- Real-time processing requirements (<1 second latency)
- Multi-region deployment
- High availability (99.9% SLA)

## Decision
We will use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams as our primary event streaming platform.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Fully managed service reduces operational overhead
- Native AWS integration with other services (Lambda, S3, etc.)
- Automatic scaling capabilities
- Built-in encryption and security features
- Multi-AZ durability
- Proven scale (handles trillions of records per day globally)

### Negative
- Vendor lock-in to AWS
- Higher cost compared to self-managed Kafka at scale
- Limited to 1MB per record
- 24-hour default retention (can extend to 365 days with additional cost)

## Alternatives Considered

### Apache Kafka (Self-Managed)
- **Pros**: Full control, cost-effective at scale, mature ecosystem
- **Cons**: High operational overhead, requires Kafka expertise, complex multi-region setup

### Amazon MSK (Managed Kafka)
- **Pros**: Kafka compatibility, managed service, good tooling ecosystem
- **Cons**: Higher cost than Kinesis, still requires some Kafka expertise

### Google Pub/Sub
- **Pros**: Global service, good scaling, simple API
- **Cons**: Would require multi-cloud setup, less integration with AWS services

## Implementation Notes
- Use Kinesis Scaling Utility for auto-scaling
- Implement enhanced fan-out for low-latency consumers
- Use Kinesis Analytics for real-time stream processing
- Set up cross-region replication for DR
