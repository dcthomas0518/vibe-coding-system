# Vibe Coding Enhancement Roadmap
*Generated: August 2, 2025*

## Week 1: Foundation (Aug 5-9)

### Monday: Thinking Integration ✓ 30 min
```markdown
Add to ~/CLAUDE.md:
## Thinking Mode Strategy
- Simple tasks: No explicit thinking
- Standard development: "think"
- Complex/Security: "think hard"
- Novel algorithms: "ultrathink"
- Between-tool thinking: Enable during searches
```

### Tuesday: Token Monitoring ✓ 1 hour
```bash
# Create ~/scripts/token-monitor.sh
#!/bin/bash
MAX_PROMPTS_PER_WINDOW=800
WARNING_THRESHOLD=640
# Track: timestamp, prompts, model, project
# Alert when approaching limits
```

### Wednesday: CTO Role Update ✓ 2 hours
- Update ~/CLAUDE.md with CTO responsibilities
- Remove CD/CC separation
- Add team orchestration section
- Test role activation

### Thursday: First Subagents ✓ 3 hours
- Create architect subagent
- Create dev-lead subagent  
- Create frontend-dev subagent
- Test delegation flow

### Friday: Playwright MCP ✓ 2 hours **HIGHEST ROI**
```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/mcp-server-playwright
# Configure with vision mode
# Test with screenshot task
```

## Week 2: Team Building (Aug 12-16)

### Monday: Quality Team
- Create qa-engineer subagent
- Define test coverage enforcement
- Implement UAT coordination

### Tuesday: Security & Backend
- Create security subagent
- Create backend-dev subagent
- Test security review flow

### Wednesday: Infrastructure
- Create devops subagent
- Define deployment protocols
- Test CI/CD integration

### Thursday: Multi-Claude Setup
- Document tmux configuration
- Create parallel session guide
- Test 3-Claude workflow

### Friday: Performance Tracking
- Implement metrics collection
- Create performance dashboard
- Baseline current velocity

## Week 3: Advanced Features (Aug 19-23)

### Monday: Remaining Specialists
- Create data-engineer
- Create perf-engineer
- Create tech-writer

### Tuesday: Specification Evolution
```markdown
Transform SP-XXX format:
- invariants: What must remain true
- mutations: What changes
- proofs: How to verify
- rollback: Recovery plan
```

### Wednesday: Context Optimization
- Implement boundary rotation
- Create context templates
- Test performance impact

### Thursday: Safety Framework
```markdown
Production Gates:
1. Behavioral specs first
2. 30-second rollback ready
3. Error boundaries everywhere
4. PM validates behavior only
```

### Friday: System Review
- Measure productivity gains
- Document learnings
- Plan Month 2 enhancements

## Month 2: Scaling (September)

### Week 1: Automation
- GitHub Actions integration
- Automated testing pipelines
- Continuous deployment

### Week 2: Advanced Patterns
- Multi-project orchestration
- Cross-team collaboration
- Resource optimization

### Week 3: AI Senate
- Implement consultation protocol
- Define major decision criteria
- Test governance model

### Week 4: Self-Improvement
- System self-analysis
- Automatic optimization
- Evolution protocols

## System Self-Improvement Protocol (The Game Changer)

Add to CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
## System Self-Improvement Protocol
Every Friday at 4pm:
1. Analyze week's velocity metrics
2. Identify system bottlenecks
3. Propose system updates
4. Test improvements in sandbox
5. Deploy successful changes

The system that improves itself becomes unstoppable.
```

### Implementation:
```bash
# Create weekly analysis script
cat > ~/scripts/weekly-evolution.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
# System self-improvement analysis
echo "=== Weekly System Evolution ==="
echo "1. Velocity: $(analyze_sp_completion_rate)"
echo "2. Bottlenecks: $(identify_slow_patterns)"
echo "3. Proposed Updates:"
# AI analyzes and suggests improvements
EOF
```

### Expected Evolution:
- Week 1-4: Process refinements
- Month 2: New subagent types emerge
- Month 3: Architectural patterns evolve
- Month 6: System barely recognizable (10x better)

## Success Criteria

### Week 1 Complete When:
- [ ] Thinking modes active
- [ ] Token monitoring operational
- [ ] 3 core subagents created
- [ ] Playwright taking screenshots

### Week 2 Complete When:
- [ ] 7+ subagents operational
- [ ] Multi-Claude documented
- [ ] Security reviews active

### Week 3 Complete When:
- [ ] All 10 subagents created
- [ ] Specs evolved to contracts
- [ ] Safety gates implemented

### Month 1 Success:
- 50% productivity improvement
- Zero production incidents
- PM satisfaction increased
- Team velocity predictable

## Quick Wins Priority

1. **Playwright MCP** - Immediate 3x on UI work
2. **Thinking Modes** - Better first-attempt success
3. **Token Monitoring** - Avoid rate limits
4. **Core Subagents** - Delegation clarity
5. **Multi-Claude** - Parallel execution

## Remember

Each enhancement is independent. Implement in any order based on immediate needs. The roadmap is a guide, not a rigid schedule.
